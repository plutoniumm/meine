## System Usage

### Docsify
_meine_ is built on top of [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), a lightweight documentation site generator that is easy to use and customize. As a result of which we get a few things for free, like the sidebar is always in `_sidebar.md` and any articles you add to it will show up and the ones you don't wont.
